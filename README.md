### Summary

This is a personal University final assignment from 2017; The time limit for this assignment is 7 days. The goal is to use C# to design a web application, featuring login and registration functionalities, and storing data locally. The website incorporates Parallax Scrolling and interactive hover effects on the homepage, showcasing technology topics with navigable “Learn More” links. The “Companies & Organization” section uses a 12-column grid layout with Parallax effects and informative text boxes for major enterprises. An external jQuery plugin and Elastic Grid power the “Emerging Technology” section, with updated content and links. The “World Maps” section utilizes the RESTful Google Maps API centered on London, though marker overlap remains an issue. The design concludes with standard contact and about sections, integrating Bootstrap components and consistent styling throughout.

### 1.	Index: 
Parallax Scrolling and intro on first image, next 6 images using the hover sector. When the mouse hovers on top, it shows the information about 6 tech. Click learn more, jump forward to the page Emerging Technologies.

After the 6th image, add the next section using Parallax Scrolling with a centred title.

Below that, insert a Bootstrap Carousel reused from the original index page.
Make sure to adjust the image sizes and update the accompanying text.

For the "Learn More" button, ensure it links to the appropriate section of the website.

Footer: No changes needed — just copy and paste from the original.

### 2.	Companies & Organization: 

I’m using Parallax Scrolling for the “What’s New” section. I leave space for each image. For images of each enterprise, the 12-column grid is divided into two 6-column sections, with <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> used to add a gap between them.

For big images such as Amazon and CSIRO, I use Parallax Scrolling to create a cooler effect, similar to Google and Microsoft shown below. Also, add a text box positioned in the bottom right corner to introduce each company.

### 3.	Emerging Technology:

For this section, I Used an external jQuery plugin from the tutorial and Elastic Grid. Update the text, images, and website links accordingly.

### 4.	World maps:

I have followed the tutorial provided and updated the locations, centring the map on London by utilising the RESTful Google Maps API. However, I noticed that some of the markers are clustered too closely together, causing them to overlap and making it difficult to distinguish individual locations.
